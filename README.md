* This Repository contains Matlab Solutions to the Course and Course Notes as a PDF. 
* I would recommend you to solve all the problems on your own. If you are really stuck some where you can take a look at the solutions in this Repository.
* The **MachineLearning-ex** contains the code for each exercise.The code was developed using Matalb Online the access of which you get in the course.So some the files with extension **mlk** might not open locally.
* The **pdf** contains all the Notes for each week in the corresponding folders and are named in the sequence in which they appear in the course.
